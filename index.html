        <p id="blog1">“Stop worrying about the potholes in the road and enjoy the trip” - Babs Hoffman We had a fairly long travel day today, through beautiful scenery, driving down out of the Western Ghats from Thekkady to the west coast city of Kochi (aka Cochin). We finished packing up, had breakfast, and left at 8 am. We drove down and down the lush hills, passing coffee plantations (they grow the robusta coffee beans here), and trees with beautiful orange flowers called African tulip trees. </p>

        <h1><i>History of Travel Blog</i></h1>
        <p id="blog2">ravelBlog.org was developed to help people share their real life travel experiences with friends, family and other travelers. Although there have been many additions to the services TravelBlog.org offers, the website retains this principle and remains both free to use and independent.[1] As of October 2007, TravelBlog.org held over 50,000 members and hosted over 200,000 blog entries.[1]

            The site allows travelers to notify subscribers whenever an update is made to their blog. The core features of TravelBlog.org are to allow members to share unlimited photos, embed videos, create maps, and participate in forums.</p>
